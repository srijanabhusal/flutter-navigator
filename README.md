# Flutter navigator

Navigator is one of the most essential tool in Flutter if you have to back and forth the pages to display them. Often you have to jump from one page to another and this can be achieven through navigators in Flutter. Navigators can be named or unnamed. The named navigators tell you exactly where to jump while unnamed navigators just help you move to next immediate page.
